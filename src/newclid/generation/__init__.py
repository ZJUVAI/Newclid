"""
Generation module for geometry problem generation.

This module provides tools for:
- Sampling geometric problems and constructions (ProblemSampler)
- Processing geometry problems (ProblemWorker)
- Batch generation pipeline (ProblemPipeline)
- Filtering goals (GoalFilter)
- Generating statistics reports (Statistics, get_first_predicate)

Public API:
    ProblemSampler: Sample geometric constructions
    ProblemWorker: Process single problems with proof validation
    ProblemPipeline: Batch generation with parallel processing
    GoalFilter: Filter valid geometry goals
    Statistics: Statistics collection and reporting
    get_first_predicate: Extract first predicate from problem string
