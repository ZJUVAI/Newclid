SubsumptionTester - Test if one rule subsumes another.

A rule R1 subsumes R2 if:
- R1 can solve R2's source problem (using R1 as an additional rule)

This is tested by:
1. Loading R2's source problem
2. Adding R1 as a custom rule
3. Running DirectSolver (Python DDARN) to see if the problem is solved
