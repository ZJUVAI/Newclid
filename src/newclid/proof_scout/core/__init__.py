"""
Proof Scout Core Module - Core graph structures and utilities (no ML dependencies)

This module provides the fundamental building blocks for proof graph analysis:
- ProofGraph: Main proof graph data structure
- SingleProofGraph: Single-problem graph wrapper
- GraphPruner: Iterative graph pruning
- ProofGraphVisualizer: Graph visualization (lazy loaded)
- FilterAndPruneEngine: Filter and prune pipeline
- AuxExtractor: Auxiliary point extraction
- SubgraphExtractor: Subgraph extraction and pruning
